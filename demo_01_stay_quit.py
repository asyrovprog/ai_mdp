# Simple game: at  initial  state  (s0)  we  have  2  actions  'stay' and 'quit', if we
# 'quit' we  get  $10  and  game  ends  (s1), if we 'stay' than with probability 2/3 we go to
# state s0 with reward $4, or with probability 1/3 we go to end state (s1) with also reward $4.
# For this game discount is default 1.0.
#
# Expectation for <stay> policy is $12 from E = 2/3($4 + E) + 1/3($4)
# Expectation for <quit> policy is obviously $10
# Expectation for random policy is $10.5 which is found from system of equations:
#   E  = 1/2($10) + 1/2(E')
#   E' = 2/3($4 + E) + 1/3($4)
